Most of the stuff changed, here's what it'll be:

This application, when first started, presents a dialogue, to make it a "Student" build or a "Professor"
build.

A Student build :
  - Creates a student account.
  - Selects one or multiple Professors to listen to (IPs).
  - Takes materials and tests.
  - Can view information about his profile and progress, and review itself.
  - Obeys calls from the supervising Professor.

> Obey calls from the supervising Professor :
  This means that, even though the student has nothing to do with anything outside their spectrum,
  except selecting their professor, the client itself does all that without the student's input.

A Professor build :
  - Creates, edits and deletes modules and module bits, locally or across its students.
  - Can make calls to students and receive data regarding their profile or progress, basically anything.

There will exist a certain passcode, to not allow app builds to simply be modified into a professor one.
