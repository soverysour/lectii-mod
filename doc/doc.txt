so, how will this work :

The thing is started, then : 

    Loads the main frame, where stuff will be displayed.

    Begins loading all the data, decodes it, optionally says something failed.

    If everything up to that point is succesful, it shows the login screen, for storing progress. ( similar to choosing your profile from a game. ).

    Then, it displays the menu, with highlights as to what has already been done.



What there is to do is to read through the info and then do tests.

The type of loaded info is :

-Audio Files for listening to.
-Pictures for a fancier UI or pictures about the subject of the lesson

-Information about:
    1. The Author
    2. The Literal Current
    3. The Actual Opera

-Exercises of type:
    1. Drag and drop D##D
    2. True or False T##F
    3. Sort the pieces S##P
    4. Complete with the right element C##E

How will this be done ? 
1. The profiles will be stored locally, in C:\Profile.
2. The stored data will have a certain directory structure with settings, making the frames adaptable. For example, in the "Tests" directory, there are multiple problems to solve, which can be initial ( are done before reading ) and normal ( done when one wants to ). There can also be a order in which the problems can be solved. Problems with the same order number are put together in the same "test". 
3. All the pictures will be stored in a "pics" folder, with a certain name, so that they can be inserted in parts of the lesson.
4. Same goes for the audio files. Just that they are also put inside the "gallery", to be listened to at the user's desire.



So, for now, start the app and load everything into itself.
