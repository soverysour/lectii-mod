So, what is all this :

When it starts, you are asked to log in or to make an account. This is so it can track your progress and tie it to a certain identity.

Then, the main frame appears, where you can choose from the "Written Material" section, from the "Tests" section, or from the "Gallery" section, where pictures, audio and even video might be found.
Material from "Written Material" and "Tests" may require a certain level of progress tied to the account.

****Make the login / register frame with interaction and all that.

So, what to do now, since all the loading has been done...

-Make the main frame, able to function properly after logging in.
-Add options to go to the Materials Area, to the Tests Area and to the Gallery.
-Make it so that Material is displayed properly.



The types of problems that will exist are : 
-Choose the correct variant. C##V
-Drag and drop. D##D
-Complete the empty line. C##E

--------------

New TODO: 

Change the way everything so far works, providing small code revamps
The proper loading of the types of problems from the tests.
The proper registration for the teachers.

-Do checks so the data in the setari.txt file doesn't allow for the user to have {  token.

How a block inside the setari.txt file, of a test or a material should look:

Material = 

[name.txt] { ["mat"|"tes"], ["titlu"], [nivel]
